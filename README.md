# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website created to comply for The Odin Project's foundations course. It is a static html page that has a few links for some recipes that I chosed. The skills I demonstrated in this are only writing html and some basic git workflow commands to stage, commit, and push the changes using the terminal. I expect to improve this project's design once I learned css in this course.
