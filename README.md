# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website created to comply for The Odin Project's foundations course. It is a static html page that has a few links for some recipes that I chosed from https://www.allrecipes.com/. The skills I demonstrated in this project are:

* Writing HTML structure of each recipe page.
* Some basic git workflow commands to stage, commit, and push the changes using the terminal. 
* Apply external css rules for styling and organizing the elements of the page via box model and display type manipulation.

Upon learning some fundamental css concepts, the website was updated to improve user experience.
